# üåç Energy trends & a peek at CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: a global snapshot.
Hey there! This is a repository part of a project where I explore how energy consumption and CO2<sub>2</sub> emissions have evolved over time. I start by looking at energy consumption worldwide (both total and per capita), before moving onto taking a closer look (at regional and country level).<br>
After that, it's time to look at the energy mix. Where does the energy we consume comes from? How has this energy mix evolved over time? In the project, I look into the global energy
mix, as well as at regional level. Also, in a world generally aiming to shift our energy sources towards cleaner alternatives, which countries lead the way in doing this?<br>
Next, I have a peek at CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Again, I start by exploring how they have evolved over time, and move down to regional and country level. What countries emit the
largest amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. And, lastly, how do these emissions correlate with primary energy consumption? And with the use of renewables?
