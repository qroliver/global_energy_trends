# üåç Energy trends & a peek at CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: a global snapshot.
Hey there! Welcome to this repository, part of a project where I explore how global energy consumption and CO2<sub>2</sub> emissions have evolved over time. I start by looking at energy consumption worldwide (both total and per capita), before zooming in to examine patterns at regional and country levels.<br>
<br>
After that, it's time to look at the energy mix. Where does the energy we consume come from? How has this mix evolved over the years? And, in a world increasingly aiming for cleaner energy alternatives, which countries lead the way in renewables?<br>
<br>
Next, I take a look at CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Again, I start with a global overview before zooming in on regional and country levels. Which nations are the biggest emitters? And finally, how do these emissions correlate with primary energy consumption? And with the use of renewables?<br>

This repository contains the data (after some processing) and the code with some analysis, but the full story, presented in a blog format with detailed explanations, can be found

If you are curious about how energy we consume and where it comes from, as well as how CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are evolving over time, please do not hesitate to explore the blog post. You'll get a picture of the present, how we got here and where we are heading.
